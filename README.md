This came from an app called VS GPS PRO.
I first decompiled the APK file that was installed on my phone
I then moved the file to a rooted pc and flashed the firmware file to a usb stick
the file in this repository is all the files that were flashed to the USB drive


after snooping around a bit to find what restricted my drones follow me speed
i found a file that was for the drones camera and there was camera 1 and camera 2
except my drone only has 1 camera.

leading me to believe this firmware is from a much better drone originally and reused

there are also log in details and password details but i didnt inspect them past that

let me know if you find a way to make my folow me faster. thanks
